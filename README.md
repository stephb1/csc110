Fundamentals of programming I - all labs and assignments coded in Python. Practiced using object-oriented programming to design and implement programs. Studied various fundamentals of high-level programming languages as well as applicable and transferable problem solving skills.

Not all code in assignment files is my own. Some files, instructions, and/or functions were provided as part of the assignments. All of my code is labeled as my own in the form of comments. Credit to Professor Berg at Uvic for assignment materials.

Note: some test cases and function descriptions were provided with assignment files and some were written by me.
